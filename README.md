INST742 Git and Python Session (Feb. 20, 2017)
==============
Myeong Lee, DCIC, iSchool
--------------

This repo provides course materials about Git and Python (Jupyter) for the INST 742 class.
Each folder has brief explanations about the topic and and source codes, if any. 

For both of these topics, you need to get familiar with command line tools (e.g., Git Shell, Bash, Terminal). Of course, using a command line tool instead of GUIs is not intuitive, but Git and Python require only basic commands. Don't worry.
