### Python: a Programming Language
- Scripting language (high-level).
- Relatively easy to learn (compared to C, C++, or Java).
- Widely used in many fields (from software development to data analytics).
- Many libraries available.
- Generally faster than R or SPSS.
- Object-oriented programming supported.
- Django framework for web development.

### Python IDEs (Integrated Development Environment)
- Pydev with Eclipse
- PyCharm
- Sublime Text
- Spyder
- Emacs
- VIM
- ...

### Jupyter: A Web-based Interactive Development Environment for Python
- Markdown supported: can export a well-styled document to various formats such as a HTML file.
- Line-by-line coding supported. Especially this is useful for data manipulations using Python.
- Graphical libraries can be directly used (while traditional Python IDEs do not provide graphics on its own). 
- Work on Jupyter can be exported to a genuine Python file (if needed).

### An Important Check Point: Python Version
Many Python libraries and existing codes available on the Internet and from open source projects are written in Python 2.x, while Python 3.x was introduced long ago. When using other's code or libraries, make sure that you're using the same version of Python. For today's exercise, we're using Python 3.5 that comes with [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/anaconda-overview), an open source package that contains useful software for data science. 

For advanced users: Anaconda's ["Virtual Environment"](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/20/conda/) feature allows you to switch between different Python versions easily on the command line.
