# Exercise 2: OCR Data Processing
- **Condition**: there is a scanned document from 1930's. We used OCR to recognize texts on the document. Then, OCR output a "txt" file (i.e., a plain text file with no structure). We want to organize the messy texts into a structured format so it looks like an Excel file. We can do this using Python scripts.

- Executing the code
	1. Go to `python/ex2/notebook/`
	2. Type `jupyter notebook` and hit enter.
	3. The code is already there. Execute block by block using `Shift + Enter`
	4. The output files will be saved in `python/ex2/data/`
	5. Check the CSV file using Excel.

- Exporting the code to a HTML file with Markdown-styled text.
	1. Position your cursor in a block.
	2. Try to insert a new block by clicking the `Insert` menu.
	3. Change the new block's mode to `Markdown`.
	4. Try to type Markdown wordings. 
	5. In the menu bar, click `File -> Download as -> HTML`
	6. Open the downloaded file in your browser. It is a pure HTML file automatically generated from Jupyter Notebook. In this way, you can generate a Python-based styled document for web.
