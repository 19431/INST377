# Exercise 2: OCR Data Processing
- **Condition**: there is a scanned document from 1930's. We used OCR to recognize texts on the document. Then, OCR output a "txt" file (i.e., a plain text file with no structure). We want to organize the messy texts into a structured format so it looks like an Excel file. We can do this using Python scripts.

- Executing the code
	- Go to `python/ex2/notebook/`
	- Type `jupyter notebook` and hit enter.
	- The code is already there. Execute block by block using `Shift + Enter`
	- The output files will be saved in `python/ex2/data/`
	- Check the CSV file using Excel.

- Exporting the code to a HTML file with Markdown-styled text.
	- Position your cursor in a block.
	- Try to insert a new block by clicking the `Insert` menu.
	- Change the new block's mode to `Markdown`.
	- Try to type Markdown wordings. 
	- In the menu bar, click `File -> Download as -> HTML`
	- Open the downloaded file in your browser. It is a pure HTML file automatically generated from Jupyter Notebook. In this way, you can generate a Python-based styled document for web.
