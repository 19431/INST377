# Exercise 1: Web Crawling for Archival Data

- **Condition**: you are trying to download scanned documents from an archive website. Since there are too many PDF files, it takes too much time to download one by one. You want to use Python scripts to download documents on the web.

- Executing the code
	1. Go to `python/ex1/notebook/`
	2. Type `jupyter notebook` and hit enter.
	3. The code is already there. Execute block by block using `Shift + Enter`
	4. The output files will be saved in `python/ex1/download/`
	5. Check the PDF files using Excel.

- Try changing the range of the documents
	- For now, the range of the document is set from 1 to 10. 
	- Change the range so that you can download a different set of documents (don't set it too broad for this exercise -- just for saving your time now). 
	- Re-run the scripts.
	- Check the `download` folder whether all the files are successfully downloaded.

- Exporting the code to a HTML file with Markdown-styled text.
	1. Position your cursor in a block.
	2. Try to insert a new block by clicking the `Insert` menu.
	3. Change the new block's mode to `Markdown`.
	4. Try to type Markdown wordings. 
	5. In the menu bar, click `File -> Download as -> HTML`
	6. Open the downloaded file in your browser. It is a pure HTML file automatically generated from Jupyter Notebook. In this way, you can generate a Python-based styled document for web.
